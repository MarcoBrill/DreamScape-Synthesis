# DreamScape Synthesis

DreamScape Synthesis is a novel Generative AI workflow that creates immersive, surreal dreamscapes based on textual descriptions. This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to generate high-quality images from text inputs, which can be used in virtual reality, gaming, or therapeutic applications.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Converts textual descriptions into vivid, surreal dreamscapes.
- **Custom Dataset**: Supports custom datasets with text-image pairs.
- **High-Quality Outputs**: Generates high-resolution images (256x256) using a deep convolutional generator.
- **Modern Algorithms**: Utilizes GPT-2 for text encoding and a GAN-based architecture for image generation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dreamscape-synthesis.git
   cd dreamscape-synthesis

### How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Place your text descriptions in `descriptions.txt` and corresponding images in the `images` directory.
2. **Train the Model**: Run `python dreamscape_synthesis.py` to train the model.
3. **Generate Dreamscapes**: After training, use the saved generator model to generate images from text descriptions.

This project is a starting point for creating a novel Generative AI workflow in the field of DreamScape Synthesis.
